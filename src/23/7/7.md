## 7.1

Is a sorting problem!

1. Parse hands and bids
2. Write a comparing function.
3. Sort hands.
4. Sum all bids multiplied by the rank of that hand.

## 7.2

1. Change hand- and card-parsing.
2. J can act as every card -> best possible card in that moment.
   -> count "J"s reduce number of needed cards of all hands by amount of Jokers
   -> "five-of-a-kind" = 5 - Jcount
   ...
   -> "three-of-a-kind" -> 1J 
3. J acts as weakest individual card.
   -> reorder card type mappings.
