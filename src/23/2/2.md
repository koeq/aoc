# Game Plan

## 1.1

1. Save configuration of possible cubes.
2. For each game:

   - Go through all rounds.
   - Determine max cube number for each color.

   Which datastructure to use? -> 2D array.

3. Check if a single max number violates the configuration.
4. If no violation occurs:
   - Increase the sum of possible games.

# 1.2

Whats the fewest number of cubes of each color that could have been in the bag to make the game possible?
-> What is the constraint on the lower side?
-> The max numbers for each color over the whole game defines the lower side limit.
