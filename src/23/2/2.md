# Game Plan

1. Save configuration of possible cubes.
2. For each game:
   - Go through all rounds.
   - Determine max cube number for each color.

   Which datastructure to use? -> 2D array.

3. Check if a single max number violates the configuration.
4. If no violation occurs:
   - Increase the sum of possible games.
