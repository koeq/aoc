# Gear Ratios

## Task
Add up all the numbers in the engine schematic which are adjacent to a sign (but not ".").

## How?

1. Build up array of strings of the schematic. 

2. Check for each sign if there is an adjacent number:
  - for each row check each char
  - if char is a sign (except "."):
    - check adjacent fields (check if out of bounds)
    - if one adjacent field is a digit
      - get complete number 
      - add number to sum
    - else continue

3. Sum numbers which are adjacent.
