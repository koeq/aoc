## 9.1

Naive approach:

1. For each sequence:
2. Compute the next sequence in a 2D array until we find all zero sequence.
3. Extrapolate next value by going from the bottom up.

-> probably doesn't work for the large inputs. 
--> let's try it anyways and come up with something better if this fails.
