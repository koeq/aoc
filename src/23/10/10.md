## 10.1 Graph Traversal

Find the single giant loop starting at "S".
How many steps along the loop does it take to get from the starting positions to the point farthest from the starting position?

1. parse input
2. find giant loop. 

    - Starting from "S" check all directions.
    - Look at mapping and go in all possible directions (BFS vs. DFS?).
    - How do we know when we went in a wrong direction?
    - Stop when you're back at the starting position.
    
3. point farthest = total steps + 1 / 2 


Considerations:

BFS -> Queue
DFS -> Stack
