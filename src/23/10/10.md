## 10.1 Graph Traversal

Find the single giant loop starting at "S".
How many steps along the loop does it take to get from the starting positions to the point farthest from the starting position?

1. parse input
2. find giant loop. 

    - Starting from "S" check all directions.
    - Look at mapping and go in all possible directions (BFS vs. DFS?).
    - How do we know when we went in a wrong direction?
    - Stop when you're back at the starting position.
    
3. point farthest = total steps + 1 / 2 


Considerations:

BFS -> Queue
DFS -> Stack


# 10.2 Flood Fill Algorithm

- Classic computer graphics algorithm used to determine the area connected to a given node in a multi-dimensional array.
 
1. Start from a given node.
2. "Fill" or mark all neighboring nodes that are the same type or satisfy a certain condition. 
3. Recurse or iterate until node is reached that does not meet the filling criteria.
