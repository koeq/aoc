## 5.1

Whats the lowest location number that corresponds to any of the inital seed numbers?

## How?

1. Parse seed input and maps.

- Maps describe how to convert numbers from a source category into numbers in a destination category. (e.g. seed-to-soil)

- Maps describe ranges:

  - `destination range start | source range start | range length`

- Any source numbers that aren't mapped (don't fall into the range of the map) correspond to the same destination.
  (e.g. seed number 10 -> soil number 10)

2. Build up map of structs which hould the `destination range start`, `source range start` and `range length`.

3. Run all seeds through all mappings.

- if number not part of the range, map x -> x
- if number is part of the range, map x -> y

-> Get lowest location.
