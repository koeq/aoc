## 5.1

Whats the lowest location number that corresponds to any of the inital seed numbers?

## How?

1. Parse seed input and maps.

- Maps describe how to convert numbers from a source category into numbers in a destination category. (e.g. seed-to-soil)

- Maps describe ranges:

  - `destination range start | source range start | range length`

- Any source numbers that aren't mapped (don't fall into the range of the map) correspond to the same destination.
  (e.g. seed number 10 -> soil number 10)

2. Build up map of structs which hould the `destination range start`, `source range start` and `range length`.

3. Run all seeds through all mappings.

- if number not part of the range, map x -> x
- if number is part of the range, map x -> y

-> Get lowest location.

## 5.2

### Optimizations

- Try to find unnecessary loops and replace them with constat calculation
  -> Mapping to location -> inner loop

- Seeds come in ranges e.g. 79 14 is the range from 79 to 92.
  -> How can we not compute all the seeds in order to get the lowest location?

  Strategy:

  1. Compute seedStart seedEnd and rangeLength.
  2. For each mapping stage, compare seed range to the provided mapping range.
  3. If a part of the seed range fits within the mapping range, apply mapping transformation to the sub range.
  4. For seeds that do not fit into any mapping range, apply a 1:1 mapping.
  5. Repeat splitting of the ranges and store them until we reach the location mapping.
  6. Determine the lower bound of each location range -> search for the lowest.

  How to find the overlap of the ranges and split them up correctly?

```typescript
/*
  Case 1: No Overlap

  -------------------------------
  Range 1: ssssssssss
  Range 2:            mmmmmmmmmm
  -------------------------------
*/

if (seedEnd < mapStart || seedStart > mapEnd) {
}

/*
  Case 2: Partial Overlap (End of Range 1 overlaps with start of Range 2)

  -------------------------
  Range 1: ssssssssss
  Range 2:       mmmmmmmmmm
  -------------------------
*/

if (seedStart < mapStart && seedEnd > mapStart) {
  overlappingRangeStart = mapStart;
  overlappingRangeEnd = seedEnd;
}

/*
  Case 3: Partial Overlap (Start of Range 1 overlaps with end of Range 2)

  -------------------------
  Range 1:       ssssssssss
  Range 2: mmmmmmmmmm
  -------------------------
*/

if (seedStart < mapEnd && seedEnd > mapEnd) {
  overlappingRangeStart = seedStart;
  overlappingRangeEnd = mapEnd;
}

/*
  Case 4: Complete Overlap (Range 1 is within Range 2)

  -------------------
  Range 1:     sssss
  Range 2: mmmmmmmmmm
  -------------------
*/

if (seedStart >= mapStart && seedEnd <= mapEnd) {
  overlappingRangeStart = seedStart;
  overlappingRangeEnd = seedEnd;
}

/*
  Case 5: Complete Overlap (Range 2 is within Range 1)

  -------------------
  Range 1: mmmmmmmmmm
  Range 2:     sssss
  -------------------
*/

if (mapStart >= seedStart && mapEnd <= seedEnd) {
  overlappingRangeStart = mapStart;
  overlappingRangeEnd = mapEnd;
}

/*
  Case 6: Equal Ranges

  -------------------
  Range 1: ssssssssss
  Range 2: ssssssssss
  -------------------
*/

if (seedStart === mapStart && seedEnd === mapEnd) {
  overlappingRangeStart = seedStart;
  overlappingRangeEnd = seedEnd;
}
```
